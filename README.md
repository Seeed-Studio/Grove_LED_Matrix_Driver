[Grove - LED Matrix Driver v1.0](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-LED-Matrix-Driver-v1.0-p-2645.html)

The Grove – LED Matrix Driver v1.0 can be a nice helper when you need to driver a dual color LED matrix. It is built around the neat little chip STM32F103C8T6, which works at a frequency of 72MHz and very low power consumption. You can use the drivers to control a LED matrix sized at 64x32 or 32x16. And as though we’ve prepared handy and easy-to-use libraries, you only need to write few lines of code to get it working quickly and display whatever you wish.
